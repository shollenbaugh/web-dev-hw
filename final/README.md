# Assignment 13
## Savanah Hollenbaugh
I learned so much about web development and web design! I've
dabbled in HTML coding when it came to customizing Tumblr layouts but could never really explain which part functioned for which and why. The biggest process is finding out exactly which portion to adjust or change in order to get the settings you're looking for. This assignment used a lot of past components, allowing me to take and revise parts to fit my purpose and my website. It's nice to see all of these components come together and functioning in one place.
