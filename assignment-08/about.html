    <h2>This is the about page.</h2>
    <p>I chose this project as it is something I spend a lot of time working in
      both for educational purposes and for fun during free time. It's a part of
      my programs I use most frequently. There are several introductory and
      beginner tutorial videos on YouTube, some of which are how I have taught
      myself many aspects of the program.</p>
