# Assignment 08

A lot of learning with HTML is memorization, or at least keeping a reference somewhere.
Often my process requires going back into old assignments and copy/pasting html
languages that I know how to do, just can't remember the exact text for.

Styling as a whole is really interesting, especially given how much control and
free range you have over styling not only website elements but also text elements.
I'm looking forward to seeing the spectrum of things we can customize!

As usual, my work cycle requires the usage of the tutorial video for this
assignment, as well as coming up with an Instructable to create, and properly
taking screenshots of the steps. A lot of my cycle involves saving and refreshing
my changes to check that something is formatted the proper way.
