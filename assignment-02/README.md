I decided to take this class in order to expand my knowledge of not only how
the web works but also to learn more on how to design websites and change each
of the moving parts. I am very interested in how things work together to create
what we see on the web and I love the actual process of design -- whether it's
in regards to color, typography, layout, etc.

A list of things I've learned or hope to learn:

- More information about how the Internet functions and allows information to
travel.
- More about the process of actually developing websites from
the ground up.
- Possibly information on making a website look more professional and put together.
