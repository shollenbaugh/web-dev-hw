System fonts are already on your computer/system that usually are available to be used but not on the web. Web fonts are custom fonts on a server, they require
certain elements to be pulled up. Web-safe fonts are fonts that the system has which is also available on the web.
Having a fallback font allows for a backup text in case a system doesn't have the text you used, or for some reason the text can be recalled. That way, your page is not left in error or empty without a text.
Per usual, the work cycle includes tutorial, reading the website, tweaking any parts of the code that aren't written properly, saving, and pushing the changes.
