    <h1>Thumbelina</h1>
    <h2>A Hans Christian Andersen tale.</h2>


    <div class="text">
      <p>There was once a woman who wished very much to have a little child,
        but she could not obtain her wish. At last she went to a fairy, and said,
       "I should so very much like to have a little child; can you tell me where I can find one?"
       "Oh, that can be easily managed," said the fairy. "Here is a barleycorn
       of a different kind to those which grow in the farmer's fields, and which
       the chickens eat; put it into a flower-pot, and see what will happen."</p>

       <br><br>

       <p>"It is a beautiful flower," said the woman, and she kissed the red and
         golden-colored leaves, and while she did so the flower opened, and she
         could see that it was a real tulip. Within the flower, upon the green
         velvet stamens, sat a very delicate and graceful little maiden. She wa
         s scarcely half as long as a thumb, and they gave her the name of
         "Thumbelina," or Tiny, because she was so small. A walnut-shell,
         elegantly polished, served her for a cradle; her bed was formed of blue
         violet-leaves, with a rose-leaf for a counterpane. Here she slept at
         night, but during the day she amused herself on a table, where the
         woman had placed a plateful of water. Round this plate were wreaths of
         flowers with their stems in the water, and upon it floated a large
         tulip-leaf, which served Tiny for a boat. Here the little maiden sat
         and rowed herself from side to side, with two oars made of white horse-hair.
         It really was a very pretty sight.
         Tiny could, also, sing so softly and sweetly that nothing like her
         singing had ever before been heard.</p>
