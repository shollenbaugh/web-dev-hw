Universal selectors are used to style all of the elements.
Element selectors are used to style all of a certain type of element, like changing the color of EVERY heading.
Class selectors style elements that serve the same function.
ID selectors style specific elements by using its unique ID.
Your choosing of your selectors is dependent on what element you're trying to affect and whether or not it's limited to just one element.
I chose four different colors relevant to a 70s style theme. The first was a dark red #F0785E, followed by an orange  #F0C15E, then a yellow #FBE608, and finally a green that's a lighter shade to reflect the time period #D6F05E.
This work cycle started with checking my to-dos, followed by gathering images to include and match my theme. Following the video tutorial and the website information is key, followed by always saving and pushing all of my changes.
