The web and the Internet are NOT the same. The Internet is a system of connected networks reaching many around the world, while the web is 
the online content being accessed. 
The Internet could be described as a giant wire. The parts connect to send signals and communicate. Internet service providers make it 
possible to use personal computers and to be able to connect to the Internet without being an actual server.
A directory is the start of your system of files, like the root of a tree before dividing into branches.
Using a VCS can keep track of your changes, allowing you to include messages as to why a change was made. If a change made doesn't work,
the VCS allows you to go back to a previous saved version. VCS also makes way for collaboration and allows collaborators to see changes
and why they were made.
