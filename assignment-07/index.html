      <h2>Lyrics</h2>
      <p>I really thought you'd be home by now
<br>
I guess I was wrong again
<br>
I used to think I could go somewhere
<br>
Turns out I'm ill-prepared</p>
      <p>I kiss the bend of the canyon road where
<br>
I find your ghost again
<br>
You found the sky through the moonroof topless
<br>
You were so happy then</p>
      <p>I'm right, I'm wrong
<br>
I'm everything but sure
<br>
My blazing head, my freezing heart
<br>
Your five words walk out the door</p>
      <p>Would you run after me?
<br>
I feel I've stood here once before
<br>
Would you run after me?
<br>
Would you run or do we disappear?
<br>
Oh, disappear here
<br>
Would you run after me?
<br>
Would you run or do we disappear here?</p>
      <p>Now you say, "I see your face every turn I make
<br>
I find no comfort there"
<br>
I add, "I hear your voice with every mistake
<br>
It's like you're always here"</p>
      <p>I'm right, I'm wrong
<br>
I'm everything but sure
<br>
So we fight until dawn
<br>
When five words walk out the door</p>
      <p>Would you run after me?
<br>
I feel I've stood here once before
<br>
Would you run after me?
<br>
Would you run or do we disappear?
<br>
Oh, disappear here
<br>
Would you run after me?
<br>
Would you run or do we disappear here?</p>
      <p>Go, go
<br>
No stay, no go, go
<br>
No stay, no go, go
<br>
No stay, no go, go
</p>
      <p>Would you run after me?
        <br>
I feel I've stood here once before
<br>
Would you run after me or disappear here?
<br>
Oh, disappear here, disappear here
<br>
Oh, disappear here, disappear here
<br>
Oh, disappear here, disappear here
<br>
Oh, disappear here</p>
