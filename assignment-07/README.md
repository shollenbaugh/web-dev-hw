# Assignment 07
## Savanah Hollenbaugh
Divs, classes, ids, and spans are all building blocks of website creation.
Divs works to create block elements, allowing items to be grouped inside a
block. Classes group similar elements together using the same name value,
making it easier to style said element. Ids work to identify an element with
its own specific attribute. Spans work within divs to provide information that
needs to be specifically identified to a certain text.

Alt text is used to describe an image or video, and allows for more information
to be given about the media.

My work cycle for this week remained relatively the same as last week.
Tutorial is always used to follow step by step, leading me to go to Youtube,
Soundcloud, and Google to find various information to include within my index.
Saves are imperative as well as pushing all of my changes to Github.
