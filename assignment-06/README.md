I've come across forms several times when it comes to school related
things, like submitting financial aid forms, answering surveys, turning in
assignments, etc. In these cases, the forms allow professors or government
departments to receive information regarding your schooling; whether it be
the ability to see a paper you've written or a copy of a tax return.

There are several different categories within input sections. An example of a
text type would be a password input, allowing you to only receive information
if you have the correct username and/or password. These are often used with
social media, school pages, and the like. An example of a selection type would
be a radio input, used to create polls and give options of selecting between
more than one answer. A button type would be an upload button, allowing files
to be uploaded and viewed, like with homework submission.

My work cycle for this including making sure I had all necessary tabs/programs
open, like GitHub desktop and Atom. The next process was watching and following
along with the video tutorial, updating my Atom and saving as I went. Finally,
instructions were followed from the website, more saving, and allowing my updates
to push to Github.
