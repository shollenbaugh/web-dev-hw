# Assignment 05
## Savanah Hollenbaugh
A page can have up to 5 possible <head> elements and 2 different types of
<body> elements. The <head> elements process information and data important
to describing the site and essentially containing "thoughts" about the site.
The <body> elements are used for the essentially, paragraph, information.
Body elements include data that's rendered by browser and displayed on the computer,
such as the contents of the page. You could think of the two like an outline,
versus a final copy of an essay. The head elements outline what you're going to
see, what information might be reflected, while the body has the actual facts
and information you're displaying.

Structural markup is used to change the structure or layout of the document. It
can be used to break up text and organize information. Semantic markup relates
to reinforcing information, like adding emphasis to important text.

My work cycle for this assignment included watching the walkthrough and following
along, followed by reading everything within the website sections so I could
properly answer questions within the assignment on Moodle. I will continue to
save as I go along, making pushes to reflect my changes on Github.
